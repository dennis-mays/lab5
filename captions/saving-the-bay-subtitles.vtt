00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760
[Music]

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.700
The estuary the world came to call San Francisco Bay is actually three bays

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.100
and a vast inland river delta. 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.650
San Francisco Bay proper is the most well known, 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.360
with its ever spectacular dance of air,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.850
wind and water.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.120
To the north lies San Pablo Bay,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.850
nearly round in shape and exceedingly shallow.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.280
East through a second break in the coastal mountain ranges called Carquinez Strait,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.730
is a third bay,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.580
Suisun Bay. Beyond a network of rivers and channels.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.430
The highly altered river delta,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.050
formed by the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.020
provides the bay with its freshwater inflow. In the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.090
long history of the planet. Today,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.000
San Francisco Bay is a relative newcomer.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.270
We know that there have been at least four bays, at least four times

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.850
when this valley was filled with water,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.400
and there was a San Francisco Bay,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.200
and there may have been as many as seven.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.070
Twenty-seven miles West of the Golden

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.940
Gate lie the Farallon Islands.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.590
Fourteen thousand years ago,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.220
The Farallons were hills within a vast river plain extending west to the Continental Shelf

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.000
a few miles beyond. This once was the West Coast of North America.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.450
During the height of the last Ice Age,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.300
we tend to think the world was frozen over. Wooly Mammoths running around in snowy

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.760
areas and glaciers and all the peaks and actually the geological and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.460
paleontological information tells us that the environment,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.020
the climate here in San Francisco Bay region was not much different than it is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.970
today. As the last Ice Age ended today's gulf

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.000
of the Farallones was a vast plain over which a great river flowed.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.760
It was here that the first human inhabitants of the region likely lived. 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.570
Drawn by the abundant water, 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.250
fish and wildlife. 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.830
Some eight or nine thousand years ago,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.460
as the glaciers of the Wisconsin Ice Age began to melt, 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.980
the seas rose and they came across the previous shore 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.180
line which is out there just on the other side of the Farallon Islands, 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.340
came across the plain we now call The Gulf of the Farallones, 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.500
began to enter San Francisco Bay,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.870
through the Golden Gate. As sea level rose, 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.530
the great river that flowed out through a low point in the coastal range flooded.  

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.870
the river canyon, 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.660
now called the Golden Gate began to take on its present form.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.780
As water continued to rise vast river valleys inland filled as well. 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.710
Seven thousand years ago

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.830
the dramatic shift in sea level slowed. Sediment flowing in 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.330
from the surrounding hills in the great valley inland,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.550
settled around the edges of the new estuary.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.150
Plant and animal life begin to flourish.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.590
The San Francisco Bay

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.660
We know today, was born.
