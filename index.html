                    <h2>Saving the Bay</h2>
                    <p>
                        The estuary the world came to call San Francisco Bay is
                        actually three bays and a vast inland river delta. San
                        Francisco Bay proper is the most well known, with its
                        ever spectacular dance of air, wind and water. To the
                        north lies San Pablo Bay, nearly round in shape and
                        exceedingly shallow. East through a second break in the
                        coastal mountain ranges called Carquinez Straight, is a
                        third bay, Suisun Bay. Beyond a network of rivers and
                        channels. The highly altered river delta formed by the
                        Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, provides the bay with
                        its freshwater inflow. In the long history of the
                        planet. Today, San Francisco Bay is a relative newcomer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We know that there have been at least four bays, at
                        least four times when this valley was filled with water,
                        and there was a San Francisco Bay, and there may have
                        been as many as seven. Twenty-seven miles West of the
                        Golden Gate lie the Farallon Islands. Fourteen thousand
                        years ago the Farallons were hills within a vast river
                        plain extending west to the Continental Shelf a few
                        miles beyond. This once was the West Coast of North
                        America.

                    <p>
                        During the height of the last ice Age, we tend to think
                        the world was frozen over. Wooly Mammoths running around
                        in snowy areas and glaciers and all the peaks and
                        actually the geological and paleontological information
                        tells us that the environment, the climate here in San
                        Francisco Bay region was not much different than it is
                        today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the last Ice Age ended today's gulf of the Farallones
                        was a vast plain over which a great river flowed. It was
                        here that the first human inhabitants of the region
                        likely lived. Drawn by the abundant water, fish and
                        wildlife. Some eight or nine thousand years ago, as the
                        glaciers of the Wisconsin Ice Age began to melt, the
                        seas rose and they came across the previous shore line
                        which is out there just on the other side of the
                        Farallon Islands, came across the plain we now call the
                        gulf of the Farallones, began to enter San Francisco
                        Bay, through the Golden Gate. As sea level rose, the
                        great river that flowed out through a low point in the
                        coastal range flooded the river canyon, now called the
                        Golden Gate began to take on its present form. As water
                        continued to rise vast river valleys inland filled as
                        well. Seven thousand years ago the dramatic shift in sea
                        level slowed. Sediment flowing in from the surrounding
                        hills in the great valley inland, settled around the
                        edges of the new estuary. Plant and animal life begin to
                        flourish.
